## Assignment 2 - 30-07-25

### Topic: Basics of Machine Learning

This assignment introduces the foundational concepts and standard workflow used in Machine Learning (ML).

### Basics of Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

#### Types of ML
- **Supervised Learning**: Labeled data (e.g., regression, classification)
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning via reward signals
