## Git Commands Demonstrated

### Basic Commands
- `git init` - Initialize repository
- `git status` - Check repository status
- `git log` - View commit history

### Advanced Commands
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit` - Create commits
- `git branch` - Manage branches
- `git checkout` - Switch branches
- `git merge` - Merge branches
- `git remote` - Manage remote repositories

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system
- GitHub account (for remote repository)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ARCAP
   ```

2. Check the current status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. View commit history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

## Workflow Examples

### Basic Development Workflow
1. Make changes to files
2. Check status: `git status`
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Descriptive message"`
5. Push to remote: `git push origin main`

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit them
3. Push feature branch: `git push origin feature-name`
4. Create pull request on GitHub
5. Merge after review

## File Descriptions

### README.md

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep messages under 50 characters for the first line

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep main branch stable
- Delete feature branches after merging

### File Organization
- Keep related files together
- Use meaningful file and folder names
- Document your code and project structure
